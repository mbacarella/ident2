PROJECT OVERVIEW

	I started ident2 awhile ago for several reasons.
		A: I needed something to do.
		B: I wanted to make my reply something other than my
			generic UNIX username, for IRC chaos, I guess.
		C: I needed the practice.
		D: I wanted to contribute to the community!

TERMS OF USE

	Ident2 is provided under the GNU General Public License.
	This license can be viewed in the included 'COPYING' file or
	found at http://www.gnu.org/


PLANNED PORTS

	I am very much in favor of porting this server. I have hopefully
	complied with POSIX well enough to make it reasonably simple.
	Writing ports should be a no brainer as far as writing actual code
	goes. The only parts that need implementing are the three m_*
	functions listed in the MACHINE section in ident2.h

	Ident2 was developed under Linux and has been ported to FreeBSD.


PORT NOTES

	The FreeBSD port will probably only compile under FreeBSD 3.x and up
        The Linux version was tested only on 2.2.x

INSTALLATION

	Check define.h first for things you might be interested in toggling.

	./configure
	make
	make install

	If the script fails, your system is probably not supported or
	you have a buggered install. I could've also screwed up.
	If you think it's MY fault, e-mail me.
		(seek to the section CONTACT, below)

	The server should install to /usr/local/sbin/ident2

	Start the server from the command line (as root), or
	go right ahead and add it to /etc/inetd.conf if you're too
	cool for your own good. If you have no idea how to do this,
	please read the man page. ``man inetd.conf'' works nicely.
	Here is what you might use:

auth    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/sbin/ident2  ident2

	Yes, these fields are deliciously tab seperated.
	If inetd.conf has no idea what 'auth' is, make sure
	it appears in /etc/services. If not, well, you're going
	to learn how to do two new things today.

	Feel free to also spawn ident2 with tcp wrappers. It shouldn't mind.

	If you're sick of the damned thing, you can uninstall it by
	doing:
		make uninstall

	Be sure to remove it from inetd.conf if necessary.

IP MASQUERADING NOTES

        IP Masquerading support was removed. I do not feel that I can
	implement it without disgustifying my code, but furthermore, I
	don't have the time/patience to make it work.

	You can essentially achieve the same results by telling ident2
	to simply send random replies to all requests.

CONFIGURING REPLIES

	By default, without any command line options,
	ident2 should be fully usable in production environments
	that require user accountability. Divergence from the RFC
	is only achieved by command line parameters that tell it
	to do so.

	In short, if you're looking for a drop in replacement,
	just start ident2 from the command line (as root) with
	nothing else.

	If you're wondering how to set your own ident replies,
	merely create a file .ident in your home directory and
	do the following:
		echo 'ident spanky' > ~/.ident

	Start ident2 with the '-i' option. You may of course, replace
	'spanky' with whatever your preffered ident reply might be.

	Also note. If a user has the file ``.noident'' in their directory,
	replies will be disabled. You must start the server with '-n' if
	you want this feature.

MODES OF OPERATION

	Ident2 has two modes of operation. inetd child, or
	standalone daemon. The inetd child itself, never forks.
	The daemon fork()s on every accepted connection.

	Whatever the mode, execution must trickle down to the nexus
	if anything useful is supposed to happen. The function nexus()
	is basically where the logic occurs and the reply is decided on
	and dispatched.
